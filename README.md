# HelpUX - Camp Figma Hackathon (Runner Up)

Try it yourself: https://help-ux.herokuapp.com/

HelpUX is a collaborative 3D environment that can be accessed through VR headsets, desktop browsers, as well as mobile devices. In the HelpUX environment, aspiring UX/UI designers can, in real time, team up, or compete, and experience the design process by creating a prototype for an app or website together. Currently, sound capabilities are not available, but we are looking to implement that aspect soon.

So you might be wondering, how is this any different from traditional collaboration techniques like using Zoom, or Skype? Well, since the environment is live, and in a virtual environment, it allows multiple people to see and interact with each other’s 3D avatars, making the experience more intimate and community-focused.

## So how does HelpUX work?

HelpUX is designed based on a room system, where each room has a different purpose, and follows a certain workflow. 

When everyone first enters the environment, they will first see a welcome screen with a “get started” button that will lead to another screen which describes how the different rooms work. Then, you will be able to move along to the design prompt screen, where you will be presented with a design challenge. If you really don’t like the prompt you were given, you can click the shuffle button to receive a new one.

Then, as you move onto the next room, the ideation room, you will come across a 101 guide to design and ideation, which can be accessed at ANY time. Inside the ideation room, there are three tables in the center, two of which are discussion tables, where members can brainstorm together, and the other being an interview table, where members can facilitate mini interviews for persona creation and user testing. On the side walls, there are templates for personas and empathy maps to help in the ideation process, with sticky notes attached to all of them for easy note-taking. Finally, on the back wall, there are instructions and tips on how to successfully create and go through meaningful interviews. 

Once everyone is done brainstorming and creating their prototype, they can bring their creations into the presentation room, where again, sticky notes are available for comments and feedback, as iteration and constant feedback is super important in the design process. Here, you will also find an about us page where you can learn more about us, and also 4 1 on 1 feedback tables, where members can talk with one another about a certain prototype.

To create this virtual environment, we used Javascript, node.js, several open source tools from Github, and Aframe. All of the 2D templates and interface "posters" were created in Figma.
